<strong>Mirage</strong> is a game developed by a peer and I outside of school time. It follows the story of a man who finds out about a connection to ancient ancestors who lived on the island of Mirage. Inspired by a gone-home style of storytelling, this game has the player piece together the true history of their long-lost kin whilst exploring a dangerous desert island.
<br>
<br>
As the co-creator I was responsible for collaborating with my teammate on an efficient but effective story structure in which I implemented into the game through programming and level design. 
</p>

<h4>During this project I developed the following skills:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Dealing with the constraint of a limited work force by finding efficient storytelling methods</li>
	<li>To have patience, possess clarity in communication, and to be stern but positive whilst giving feedback working with other writers in the team.</li>
	<li>To be diligent in my communication with others on my team in order to keep the vision of the game clear and cogent.</li>
</ul>
