<strong>VIU</strong> is an augmented reality app focused on orienting parents, new students, and visitors to IU's campus & history. This app allows users to walk around IU's campus in
real time and tap on significant landmarks they see through their phone's camera and learn more about them. In addition, users are able to walk around and examine 3D models with their camera's phone, as well as experience 360 video whilst learning about a certain part of campus.
