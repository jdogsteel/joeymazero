<center><p><strong>VIU</strong> is an augmented reality app focused on orienting parents, new students, and visitors to IU's campus & history. The app allows users to walk around IU's campus in
real time and tap on significant landmarks they see through their phone's camera and learn more about them. In addition, users are able to walk around and examine 3D models with their camera's phone, as well as experience 360 video whilst learning about a certain part of campus.</p></center>

<p>
<b>It</b> was important for the description cards to convey information about the history of IU's campus in an engaging and clear way. Our team had to account for the diverse audience that this app would reach. Students often visit IU's campus with their families, so I ensured that the description cards were able to be comfortably read by parents, students, and any little brother or sister they brought along.

<br>
<br>

I made sure that the history behind it was relevant to showing off IU's most interesting aspects, and that the supporting diction was clear, consice, and easy to read. While we did not get the chance to localize the text to accomidate for IU's international student base, we were conscious towards using a non-technical and universal style of English that would be more easily understood by non-native speakers.
</p>

<h3>3D Models</h3>
<p><b>Being</b> responsible for placing the 3D models meant that I was in part responsible for the end user experience. Knowing this, I took extra care in making sure that the models were accurate in size to the real-life versions, and that they were placed in a way that made observing them a fun and memorable experience (see above picture!).</p>

<h3>Accomplishments:</h3>
