<h3>My Responsibilities:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Build and drive home a theme about miscommunication.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Incorporate a branching narrative via <strong>Inkle</strong> that reacts to the player's in-game decisions.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Work directly with programmers, designers, and artists to create gameplay that supports a paranormal-noire atmosphere.</li>
	<br>
	<li>As Narrative Lead, provide story outlines to promote teamwide communication and vision cogency on the narrative.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>The Theme:</h3>

<img style = "float: right" src="images/LorraineShadowGlow.png" alt="The Shadows That Linger" height="350" width="350" />

<p><strong>The</strong> biggest inspiration behind the theme came from when our lead designer told me about the core mechanic of the game: an ethereal ability
that allows you to speak to a character's physical shadow. I made each of these characters' "shadows" represent their own unique and deep emotional insecurites, so that when the player got an opportunity to communicate with one, it was as if they were peering into that character's unfiltered and primal thoughts.</p>

<p>Through this definition, the narrative purpose of this mechanic was realized and allowed for the player to observe an interesting dichotemy of what a character
was saying versus what their shadow revealed. This played very well into the mystery aspect of the game by serving as a vehicle into the motivations behind each character.
I was able to deliver on the theme of miscommunication by showing the distrust characters had in themselves and, subsequently, those around them.

<br>
<br>

<h3>A Systematic Narrative:</h3>

<img src="images/inkSnap.png" style = "float: right" alt="The Shadows That Linger" height="350" width="475" />

<p><strong>Immersing</strong> the player in a story that feels reactive to their gameplay style was an important part of our vision for the game. This is why I
implemented a narrative system that shapes the story based on the player's relationships with other characters and the actions they take in the world, without breaking
the bank on scope. This was achieved by finding the balance between giving the player actual game-altering decisions with more small-scope decisions that <i>felt</i> impactful.</p>

<p>This required the tracking of outside gameplay variables as well as internal story variables that represent the current state of a player-character relationship. By performing variable checks at the appropriate times, we were able to have characters that reacted based off of the player's gameplay as well as their relationship.</p>
