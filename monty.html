<strong>Monty</strong> is a game developed by my classmates and I in University in our first game workshop class. Monty is a unit-management puzzle platformer in which the player uses its gummy bears to stretch and bounce to solutions.
<br>
<br>

</p>

<h4>During this project I developed the following skills:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Learned the process of iteration through redeveloping Monty's concept multiple times in order to reach our vision for the player experience.</li>
	<li>Rapidly prototyped a gummy bear controller.</li>
	<li>Developed the skills necessary to maintain a design document and update it regularly according to the state of our game.</li>
</ul>
