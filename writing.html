<p>As narrative lead on <i>The Shadows That Linger</i>, a point and click murder mystery game, I worked with designers, writers, and artists to craft a story
that worked in tandem with mystery solving mechanics in a paranormal-noire atmosphere.

<td><p>To maintain communication between designers and writers, I wrote act outlines that were regularly updated as I iterated on the narrative. They included dialogue choice references, story beats, and the purpose behind conversations between characters.</p>

<h2>VIU</h2>
<p>As content manager on <i>VIU</i>, an augmented reality app aimed at educating new and visiting people on Indiana University's campus history, I worked with alongside the project's software developer
to create an engaging experience reading the informational description cards of various interactable 3D models.
<div style = "padding-left: 55px;">

<table style = "table-layout: fixed;">
<td style = "width: 250px;"><img src="images/governor.png" alt="The Shadows That Linger" height="250" /></td>
<td><p>I managed what stories of IU's campus history would be covered, as well as editing the card descriptions to fit a form of non-technical and universal English that would be easily understood by people of all ages and non-native speakers.</p>
