<p>
<strong>For an independent study</strong> under professor <a href = "https://provost.indiana.edu/images/2020-retfac/chabin.pdf" style = "color: #117400" target = _blank>Michael Chabin</a> of the Informatics department, I developed a virtual reality game which teaches kids about the moon. The game features VR movement mechanics such as astronaut suit thrusters, walking, and running. I simulated the scale of the moon's distance from the earth as well as its orbit.
<br>
<br>
Narrated by a robot entity named Luna, the VR game is designed to be teaching kids through narration while they experience live examples. This is meant to strengthen the connection between the child and the lesson. Throughout the game, kids experience events like flying through space, riding on the moon as it orbits the earth, and seeing an example of the moon's effects on the tides.
</p>

<h4>What I did:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Used research tools to develop an accurate model of the earth and the moon in Unity.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Programming a zero gravity physics-based movement system with the HTC Vive.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Deliver an educational narrative about the moon in a style that resonates with kids.</li>
</ul>
