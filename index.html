  "<h1>Ekter and The Cub</h1><p><b>Role: Designer, Programmer, Writer, Project Lead</b></p>" + 
  "<p>In the development of Ekter and The Cub I was responsible for gameplay programming including movement and animation. " +
  "I also took part in the design of levels, enemy behaviors/traits, and our game's final boss fight. " +
  "As project lead I oversaw that everything was delivered by our team on time, implementation, and encouraging a positive environment " +
  "where programmers, designers, and artists work together in an efficient manner.</p>"
 
  
  var starText = 
  "<h1>Before There Were Stars</h1><p><b>Role: Programmer, Writer</b></p>" + 
  "<p>Before There Were Stars is a game that revolves around the dialogue development between two characters. In this project there is " +
  "a star-connecting mechanic that allows the player to reveal constellations in the sky. I was responsible for programming this mechanic, " +
  "and the dialogue system which is in development. I also co-wrote the script, as it is centered around dialogue-triggering events.</p> "
  var battleText = 
    "<h1>Battle Battle Character Design</h1><p><b>Role: Designer</b></p>" + 
  "<p>As part of a design challenge, I was given a set of rules for a dice game and tasked with making my own character. " +
  "This included tweaking the existing systems of the characters that already existed, and adding rules to the game. " +
  "I also sketched for this character, as shown in the picture. This project increased my skills on systems design, " +
  "as there were an existing pool of designed characters, and I added one that was balanced, but added a different twist to the game.</p>"
  var idleText = 
    "<h1>Idle Game Pitch Document</h1><p><b>Role: Designer, Writer</b></p>" + 
  "<p>Mining Expedition X is an idle game where one acquires valuable magical runes by drilling through the crust of a planet. " +
  "I created a design document that is an example of how I can communicate a game's goals and systems clearly to developers. " +
  "As well as creating a generator multiplier system, I wrote about the game's lore and set up a backstory. </p> "
  var cindText = 
    "<h1>Cinderella Board Game</h1><p><b>Role: Designer</b></p>" + 
  "<p>Fish For Your Life is survival board game in which the player starts with an expendable amount of fish and health. " +
  "I took part in a team of four of designing a survival board game in which the player is entertained by random rolling but still " +
  "has enough control in the game to feel like they have power. Fish For Your Life is an excitingly paced survival board game "
  "where players engage in meaningful gameplay.</p>"
